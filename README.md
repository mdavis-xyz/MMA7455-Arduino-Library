It is based on the code from the [Arduino website](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MMA7455). There are some additional functions and some slight changes to the existing functions. The code has also been abstracted out into a library.

To use this library, simply paste `MMA7455.h` and `MMA7455.ino` into the same folder as your main `.ino` file. Then add the following line to the top of your code.

    #include "MMA7455.h"
